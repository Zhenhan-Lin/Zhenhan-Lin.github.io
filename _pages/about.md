Hi! This is Zhenhan Lin, and I’m thrilled you’ve decided to learn more about me and my work.

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Florida. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Technology at Hangzhou Dianzi University.

Among the areas of computer science in which I have studied, my research interests are interdisciplinary, bridging the domains of machine learning algorithm, information theory, computational biology, and neuro-engineering.

Currently, I'm doing research intern with [Prof.Maizie(Xin) Zhou](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/zhou-maizie).
